title: From Penduka we went on to the Heroe's Acre.  This is a huge monument to commemorate the Namibian Freedom Fighters.  Its so interesting to see this history of their struggle for freedom in a country that is Barely 30 years old.  Here's a picture of Josh Maritin from the base of the monument.
